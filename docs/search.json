    "text": "During the summer of 2022, the region of Galicia was devastated by wildfires, with over 40,000 hectares burned in just July and August. The fire outbreak began with an intense dry storm on the evening of July \\(15^{th}\\), which brought with it over 6,000 lightning strikes in less than 4 hours. The same week, temperatures in Ourense reached a record high of 44ºC, with similar heat waves reported throughout the province. These extreme weather conditions created the perfect storm for the spread of devastating wildfires.\nThe year 2022 was marked by a severe drought, which affected not only the summer months but also late winter and spring, a crucial time for replenishing the trees’ water supply. This shortage of water caused significant stress to the vegetation, which was further exacerbated by the ongoing rural abandonment. With no human intervention, dead biomass accumulated in large quantities, creating dangerous conditions for wildfires. The unusual weather conditions combined with the high amount of fuel available led to an unprecedented number of wildfires, which overwhelmed the firefighting resources and were difficult to contain. The existing firefighting infrastructure was not equipped to handle such a catastrophic situation.\nIn this study, I studied how the vegetation stress evolved over time. To relate it, a comparison was made of a relatively normal (average precipitation) year as it was 2021 with 954 registered wildfires and only 4,400 ha burned, against a dry year as 2022 with more than 40,000 ha burned in only 2 months (July and August).\nThe aim of this work was to study the spatio-temporal dynamics using vegetation indices derived from remote sensing images. The specific objectives were: (1) to study spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation statues using the well-known Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI); (2) to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation moisture through the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI); (3) to define the burned area and its severity."
